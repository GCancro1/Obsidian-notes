# Stacks and Queues

#### Priority Queue: 
Stores pairs containing a priority and a value
Operations: 

		Insert(x,v) - insert value v with priority x
		extract_min() - return or remove pair with the min key value

Naive Solution:
	- Store items in linear list
	- Order? 
			Insert order: fast inert and slow extract (O(1), O(n))
			Priority order: fast extract and slow insert

#### Heap: Tree based structure
**min heap order**: for all nodes, parent's key <= node's key
many variants: 
	binary, leftist, binomial, Fibonacci, pairing, quake, skew, heaps

#### Binary Heap
- simple, elegant, efficient
- basic insert/extract: O(logn)
- build: O(n)
- left complete tree

		left(i): if (2i < n) 2i else null
		right(i): if (2i + 1 < n) 2i +1 else null
		par(i): if (i >= 2) floor(i/2) else null
	
insert(x): append(x) to end of array, sift x up while x < parent

#### Binary heap - extract min
- min key at root -> save it
- Copy A[n] to root(a[1]) and decrement n
- sift the key down
	- find the smaller of two children
	- if larger, swap with this child
- return saved root key

#### Leftist Heaps: Meldable heaps
- Can merge two heaps into single heap
- keys are heap ordered
Null path length: length of shortest path to null (npl):

	npl(v): if v = null -1 else 1 + max(npl(v.left), npl(v.right))
- all nodes n must follow: npl(n.left) >= npl(n.right)
	- Essentially, the left must always have greater height than right

**Lemma**: A leftist tree with r>=1 nodes along its rightmost path has n >= 2^r -1
