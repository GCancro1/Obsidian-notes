## First Class -- Intro to Data Structures
### Course Overview:
- Fundatmental data structures and algorithms
- Mathemmatical techniques for analyzing them
- Implementation

#### Example problems
- information retrieval 
- Georgraphic info systems
- machine learning
- text processing

#### Designing a data structure
1. Modeling: How real-world objects are encoded
2. Operations: Allowed functions to acess and modify structure
3. Representation: Mapping to memory
4. Algorithms: How are operations performed?

#### Our Approach
- Theoretical: Algorithms and asymptotic analysis
- Practical: Implementation and practical efficiency

#### Asymptotic Analysis: 
- Run time as a function of n
- Worst-case, average-case, randomized
- Amortitized: Average over a series of operations

#### Common time:
- O(1) constant (Hash map)
- O(logn): log time (binary search)
- O(n^p) where p = constant: poly time (geometric search)
