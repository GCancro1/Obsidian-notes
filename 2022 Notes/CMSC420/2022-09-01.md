# Basic Data Structures
#### Abstract Data Type:
Abstracts the functional elements of a data structure from it's implementation

#### Linear List ADT:
Stores a sequence of elements. Operations:
- init()
- get()
- set(i, x)
- insert(i, x)
- delete(i)
- length()
---
#### Implementations:
**Sequential**: Store items in an array
**Linked**: linked list 
	singly: value, next
	doubly: value, next,  prev 

Performance varies with implementation

**Stack**: LIFO list: All access from one side
	(top) + push or (top) - pop
**Queue**: FIFO list: 
	enqueue() inserts at tail and dequeue() deletes from head
**Deque**: Can insert or delete on either end

*Allocation*: What to do when your array runs out of space?
	**Doubling Reallocation**: When array of size n overflows
		1. allocate new array size 2n
		2. copy old ot new
		3. remove old array

**Dynamic (Sequential) Allocation**: When we overflow, double size

**Cost model**:
	Cheap: No reallocation -> 1 unit
	Expensive: Array of size n reallocated to 2n-> 2n+1 ?

**Amoritized Cost**: *T(m)/m* 
	Starting from an empty structure, suppose that any sequence of m operations takes time T(m).

Theorem: Starting from an empty stack, the amortitized cost of our stack operations is *at most 5* 

Proof:
1. Break the full sequence after each reallocation
2. At the start of a run there are n+1 items in stakc and array size is 2n
3. There are at least n ops beore the end of the run
4. During this time the cost is at least 5n
	- Next reallocation cost 4n, but there is enough conserved

**Fixed Incremement** n -> n + 100
**Fixed Factor**: n -> 4n
**Squaring**: n -> n^2
