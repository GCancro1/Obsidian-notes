# Disjoint set union find 1
**Equivalence Relation**: Binary relation over set S such that $$ \forall a,b,c \in S$$
Reflective: a == a
Symmetric: a == b -> b == a
Transitive: a == b, b == c -> a == c

Given a graph G, vetices u, v:
	u == v if in same connected component

**Union Find**: Given set {1,2,n}, maintain a partition supporting ops:
	Init: each element in its own set
	Union(s, t): Merge two sets and replace with their union
	Find(x): return the set containing x


**Inverted Tree approach**: Store elements of each set in tree with links to parent, root node is set identifier

##### Set simple find:
	public simple_find(Element x):
		while(parent[x] != null)
			x <- parent[x]
		return x

How to union with Trees:
1. Rank based on height of tree
2. Link lower rank as child

___
Lemma: Assuming rank based merging of a tree of height h has at least 2^h nodes. N elements -> height <= lgn

**SImple Union FInd**: perfoms a seuqence of m union + finds on a set of size n in O(mlogm) time
- Amoritized time (average per op) is O(logm)

**little Trick**:
worst case: O(logn), imrpoves amoritized time but hard to prove

**Ackermans function**:


**Inverse of the Ackerman**: $$\alpha(m,n) = min ( i > 1 | A(i, \lfloor\frac{m}{n}\rfloor), min )$$
Amoritized time: O(A(m,n))
