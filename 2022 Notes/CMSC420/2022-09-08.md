# Disjoint set union find 1
**Equivalence Relation**: Binary relation over set S such that $$ \forall a,b,c \in S$$
Reflective: a == a
Symmetric: a == b -> b == a
Transitive: a == b, b == c -> a == c

Given a graph G, vetices u, v:
	u == v if in same connected component

**Union Find**: Given set {1,2,n}, maintain a partition supporting ops:
	Init: each element in its own set
	Union(s, t): Merge two sets and replace with their union
	Find(x): return the set containing x
