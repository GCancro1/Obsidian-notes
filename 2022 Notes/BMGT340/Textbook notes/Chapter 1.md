# Corporate Finance and the Financial Manager
### 1.2: The Four types of firms
##### Sole Proprietorships:
*A business owned and run by one person.*
	1. Good for new businesses, straightforward setup
	2. No separation between the firm and the owner, no one else can hold state in the business
	3. The owner has unlimited personal liability for the firm's debts.
	4. The life is limited to the life of the owner, it is difficult to transfer ownership
##### Partnerships:
*A business owned and run by more than one owner*
	1. All partners are liable for the firm's debt.
	2. The partnership ends in the event of a death or withdrawal of any partner
	3. Partners can avoid liquidation if the partnership agreement provides for alternatives such as a buyout of a deceased or withdrawn partner.
	**Limited Partnership**: partnership with general partners and limited partners. General partners are same as usual partners, while limited partners have limited liability based on their investment
##### Corporations
*A legally defined, artificial entity separate from its owners*
	1. More costly, takes longer to set up due to state legal consent required to start
	2. Since corporations are a second legal entity, their profit's are taxed separate from owner's tax obligations. In effect, shareholders pay taxes twice. (corp pays taxes on profits, shareholders pay income tax)
	**S corps**: The firm's profits are not subject to corporate taxes, but are directly allocated to the shareholders based on ownership share.
	**C corps**: subject to corporate taxes

![[Pasted image 20220831143713.png]]**Agency problem**: when managers put their self-interest ahead of the interests of the shareholders
**Hostile takeover**: an individual or organization purchases a large faction of a company's stock and in doing so gets enough votes to replace the board of directors and CEO.
### 1.5 The Stock market
**bid-ask spread**: the difference between the ask prices and the bid prices
**limit order**: an order to buy or sell a set amount at a fixed price
**market order**: an order that trades immediately at the outstanding limit order
**dark pools**: trading systems where the limit order books are not visible
**listing standards**: the requirements a company must meet to be traded on the exchange
