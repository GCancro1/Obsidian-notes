### Double Taxation
1. Review of Income statements

	Sales - COGS = Gross Profit

	Gross profit - fixed operations costs = EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amoritization)

	EBITDA - Depreciation - Amortization = EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes)

	EBIT - Interest expense = EBT (Pre tax earnings/ profits)

	EBT - taxes (corporate tax rate * EBT) = Net Income
	
	Net Income -> dividends and change in retained earnings

Example problems:

1.
	You own 12% of Corp. EBT = $10,000,000. Corp tax rate = 37%. Personal tax rate on dividends = 16%. What are your after tax earnings?

10000000 * .63 * .12 * 1 (div payout rate, assume 1 here) * .84 = 635040
